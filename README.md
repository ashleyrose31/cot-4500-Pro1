There are 4 different parts in this assignent. I created two different folders named "main" and "test". My programming assignment 1 is in the file titled "assignment_1.py" in the "main" folder. The first requirement of the assignment states to utilize the Approimation Algorithm as showed on slide 11, chapter 2.1. For this, I approximated the square root of 2, as that mirrors the example in the slides. The second requirement is to use the bisection method to state the approximate root of x^3 + 4x^2 - 10. The third requirement is to implement fixed-point iteration. The last requirement is to use the Newton-Raphson method given that f(x) = cos(x)-x and f'(x) = -sin(x)-1.
